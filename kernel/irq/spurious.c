 *
 * There are two ways interrupt handling can go wrong - too few or too
 * many.  Due to misrouting or other issues, sometimes IRQs don't
 * reach the driver while at other times an interrupt line gets stuck
 * and a continuous spurious interrupts are generated.
 *
 * This file implements workaround for both cases.  Lost interrupts
 * are handled by IRQ expecting and watching, and spurious interrupts
 * by spurious polling.  All mechanisms need IRQF_SHARED to be set on
 * the irqaction in question.
 *
 * Both lost interrupt workarounds require cooperation from drivers
 * and can be chosen depending on how much information the driver can
 * provide.
 *
 * - IRQ expecting
 *
 *   IRQ expecting is useful when the driver can tell when IRQs can be
 *   expected; in other words, when IRQs are used to signal completion
 *   of host initiated operations.  This is the surest way to work
 *   around lost interrupts.
 *
 *   When the controller is expected to raise an IRQ, the driver
 *   should call expect_irq() and, when the expected event happens or
 *   times out, unexpect_irq().  IRQ subsystem polls the interrupt
 *   inbetween.
 *
 *   As interrupts tend to keep working if it works at the beginning,
 *   IRQ expecting implements "verified state".  After certain number
 *   of successful IRQ deliveries, the irqaction becomes verified and
 *   much longer polling interval is used.
 *
 * - IRQ watching
 *
 *   This can be used when the driver doesn't know when to exactly
 *   expect and unexpect IRQs.  Once watch_irq() is called, the
 *   irqaction is slowly polled for certain amount of time (1min).  If
 *   IRQs are missed during that time, the irqaction is marked and
 *   actively polled; otherwise, the watching is stopped.
 *
 *   In the most basic case, drivers can call this right after
 *   registering an irqaction to verify IRQ delivery.  In many cases,
 *   if IRQ works at the beginning, it keeps working, so just calling
 *   watch_irq() once can provide decent protection against misrouted
 *   IRQs.  It would also be a good idea to call watch_irq() when
 *   timeouts are detected.
 *
 * - Spurious IRQ handling
 *
 *   All IRQs are continuously monitored and spurious IRQ handling
 *   kicks in if there are too many spurious IRQs.  The IRQ is
 *   disabled and the registered irqactions are polled.  The IRQ is
 *   given another shot after certain number IRQs are handled or an
 *   irqaction is added or removed.
 *
 * All of the above three mechanisms can be used together.  Spurious
 * IRQ handling is enabled by default and drivers are free to expect
 * and watch IRQs as they see fit.

 * is prettier than mine, please go ahead and suggest better ones.
 *
 * Most parameters are intentionally fixed constants and not
 * adjustable through API.  The nature of IRQ delivery failures isn't
 * usually dependent on specific drivers and the timing parameters are
 * more about human perceivable latencies rather than any specific
 * controller timing details, so figuring out constant values which
 * can work for most cases shouldn't be too hard.  This allows tighter
